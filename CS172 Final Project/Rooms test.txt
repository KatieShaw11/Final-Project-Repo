To the east you can see a great lake in the distance, and beyond it a castle. On the north shore you can make out a forest, and to the south you see only rolling grasslands, although you can just see a dark shape on one of the hills. Behind you, to the west, is an insurmountable mountain range.

boat
You reach a rocky beach. The lake is large and the water is choppy. There is a boat tethered to a pole in the water. It’s a sunny day, but it’s misty along the beach, and you can’t see more than 20 feet in any direction, although you see that the beach stretches north.

From the boat, the water looks quite calm here. It's a nice day for a swim.

You finally make it to shore! In front of you are the castle gates. The entrance is dismal. You can feel the sadness in the air, like a sickness. Vines crawl among the bars of an iron-wrought gate, which blocks the bridge over the castle's moat.

To the west are the gates, and to the east is a narrow bridge, barely wide enough for you to stand, that passes over a moat. Murky, muddy water lazily swirls beneath you.

In front of you is a massive, heavy-looking door. The brass knocker, so high up you can barely reach it, curls forward in the shape of a snake, two bodies coming forward and meeting in the head. A matching keyhole is at eye-level.

You stand in a grand hall, with tall and majestic columns lining each side. It's just light enough inside for you to make out... a dragon! It's fierce looking, but you notice a marks around it's girth from a saddle, almost as if it's inviting you to ride it...

The surface is glimmering above you, but you see an opening below. If you could just swim down a bit farther, you could reach it.

You pull yourself through the opening, and feel yourself being carried up. You break through the surface of the water to find yourself in an underwater cave. Stalagmites and stalactites pepper the floor and ceiling, which is only about five feet high. As you peer through the columns, you see a passage the northeast.

The passage is narrow and very dark, so that you have to feel your way through. It continues northeast.
